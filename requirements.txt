How to run the project:
1. Python version 3.9.7
2. In the same directory as the main class run "python3 main.py ethereum_txs.csv pythonsqlite.db".
The ethereum_txs.csv argument is the csv file from which we read the information about the transaction.
The pythonsqlite.db is the file where the database with all the transactions will be created (you would
need to keep the same name of the file for the database as in the example, because the GET request from the
task5 will look into the file with this name). After running the
command it will take around three hours for the database to be completely populated (the reason for this is to
not receive "Too many requests" from the Coin Gecko Api: for each row we insert into the table we compute the gas price
in dollars for which we send a GET request to the Coin Geko Api).
If you don't want to wait, you can cancel it any time and take on transaction hash from database and perform the
GET request on that.
I used this link to install sqlite3 and sqlite3 for browsing through the database: 
https://linuxhint.com/install_sqlite_browser_ubuntu_1804/#:~:text=First%20open%20the%20SQLite%20database,database%20to%20your%20desired%20format.
3. For the task 5 run "python3 -m uvicorn create_api:app --reload". To test it, go to a browser and type
"http://127.0.0.1:8000/transactions/0x4543fef8d1535b037bffb36e904e9d374d2fd0a08deb5ab549b8e14e3891dfb3".
The expected response is the row from the database which contains this transaction hash. One thing to note
here is that these requests can be made only after the database is populated.
4. To run the tests run "python3 -m pytest"
